	<Paragraph>
		There’s a tendency to place graphic designers in metaphor with other roles – graphic designer as
		author, as architect, as mercenary, as translator, as curator, as artist. I get it. All of those
		functions feel so much more archetypally weighty than ‘graphic designer’, which feels so thin
		and modern. Perhaps we are interested in these re-framings and transformations because there’s
		an anxiety that comes from feeling like our entire field is stuck between being an artform and a
		service industry.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		But actually, there’s great potential in the label of ‘graphic designer.’ Why not reverse the
		direction of the analogy? Author as graphic designer, architect as graphic designer, mercenary
		as graphic designer, etc. etc. Distilled down, graphic design is just the arrangement of visual
		elements. That feels broad enough to open up the limits of what we typically think of as a
		graphic design practice. Instead of trying to embody a specific archetype, why not make use of
		the ambiguity that arises from the thinness and malleability of our field?
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		There’s not much use in trying to pigeon-hole graphic design into any one particular frame. In
		fact, I want to introduce two new archetypes into our arsenal of tools: 1) the poet, and 2) the
		world-builder.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>Here’s how I see the two are related:</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={1}>
		Metaphors for substrate/substance relationships: fungus growing on a tree trunk
	</Caption>
	
	<Paragraph
		>Worldbuilding involves developing systems of history, culture, politics, magic, lore,
		knowledge, aesthetics, etc. etc., which form the <i>substrate</i> from which narratives can play
		out. A useful phrase here might be something like ‘meta-authorship’. An even more useful phrase
		might just be ‘creating a vibe.’
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={2}>
		Metaphors for substrate/substance relationships: dendritic quartz (and crystals in general): mineral deposits grow in tree-like structures within a substrate of quarts.
	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		Poetry involves creating <i>substance</i> — the poems themselves, or whatever unit
		of poetry one wishes — out of a substrate that is based on the poet’s own personal world of interrelated
		symbols. ‘Creating something that embodies and implies a larger vibe.’ Reading poetry often involves
		a degree of opaqueness, but you usually still get a sense of the poet’s inner world.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		Can graphic designers do these things too? Be author and meta-author at the same time? My goal
		is to outline a methodology for graphic designers to think of their practice as worldbuilding,
		and to consider the potentials and poetics that lie in such an endeavor.
	</Paragraph>
	<Subheader>Graphic Design and Poetics</Subheader>
	<Caption imgIndex={3}>Excerpt from Etel Adnan's The Arab Apocalypse</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		Graphic design is often associated with pure functionalism, as a means to legibility. But there
		is great potential in developing a sense of poetics within one’s practice. Poetics – defined as
		how a text’s different elements come together and produce certain effects onto the reader –
		sounds a lot like what graphic designers already do.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		Poetry seeks to make new meaning through novel configurations of elements (words) from an
		already established system (language). Graphic design, being related to the organization and
		presentation of information, can also be seen as making meaning through novel configuration of
		various elements, which are not just limited to language and text, but also might include
		images, symbolic meaning, and visual culture writ large. Poetry, more so than other literatures,
		is concerned not only with the denotative meaning of words, but also the meaning that arises
		from the aesthetic quality of words (things like phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, rhyme, meter).
		In dealing with typography, graphic designers are also interested in both the denotative meaning
		and aesthetic qualities of a text they are working with. Both have a playful relationship to
		structure, sometimes adhering to, and sometimes breaking, form.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		However, one difference between a graphic designer’s and a poet’s oeuvre is that with each poem,
		insight is gained into the poet’s symbolic world (semiosphere). Each poem provides additional
		context for the greater body of work by adding to the mythos of the interiority of the poet. In
		contrast, it’s not so often that each poster that a graphic designer creates relates to some
		larger world or story. Often the graphic designer’s interiority is purposefully veiled in order
		to not distract from the ‘actual’ content of the poster.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		But it’s extremely worthwhile for graphic designers to approach worldbuilding, because
		worldbuilding allows for the potential for narratives to sprawl out nonlinearly. It invites a
		non-teleological reading (reading without a prescribed goal) of the text, (or image, or whatever
		the object of graphic design is). Designing for multiple layers of meaning offers a point of
		resistance against graphic design’s primary function as lubricant for the smooth flow of capital
		(be it economic, social, or otherwise), which relies on a singular, totalizing interpretation of
		the work/world.
	</Paragraph>

	<Subheader>A Methodology for Worldbuilding</Subheader>
	<Caption imgIndex={4}

		</Caption>
	<Paragraph>Here’s another framing of poetics and its motivations:</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		The goal of poetry is to produce an artifact – the poem – that is a middle ground in which the
		reader gains at least partial access to the interiority of the poet. A world that the reader is
		invited to co-inhabit. To create a middle ground, a poet has to reconcile both external
		signifiers (shared archetypes, shared language, shared cultural references) and internal
		signifiers (symbols and images, and relations that are specifically meaningful to the poet). The
		poetics lies in developing the relations between all of these signifiers.
	</Paragraph>
	
	<Paragraph>
		A poem that just contains external signifiers might feel impersonal, too literal, and too easily
		understood, and a poem that just contains internal signifiers might be so specific that it is
		unintelligible to the reader. By combining signifiers that already familiar to their audience
		with more personal narratives, images, and symbols, the poet creates entry points into the more
		untranslatable parts of their psyche. This is related to what the artist Ian Cheng calls
		‘worlding’. Cheng writes on his <Link href='https://worldto.live/'>website</Link>,
	</Paragraph>
	<Blockquote>
		“Worlding [is] a vital practice to help us navigate darkness, maintain agency despite
		indeterminacy, and appreciate the multitude of Worlds we can choose to live in and create.
		Whether you are creating art, games, institutions, religions, or life itself: LIVE TO WORLD AND
		WORLD TO LIVE!”
	</Blockquote>

	<Paragraph>He further writes in another <Link href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/">blog post</Link>:</Paragraph>
	<Blockquote>
		We could say a World is something like a gated garden. A World has borders. A World has laws. A
		World has values. A World has dysfunction. A World can grow up. A World has members who live in
		it. A World gives its members permission to act differently than outside of it. A World
		incentivizes its members to keep it alive, often with the pleasures of its dysfunction. A World
		counts certain actions inside it as relevant and meaningful. A World undergoes reformations and
		disruptions. A World has mythic figures. A World is a container for all the possible stories of
		itself. A World manifests evidence of itself in its members, emissaries, symbols, tangible
		artifacts, and media, yet it is always something more.
	</Blockquote>
	<Paragraph>
		Cheng’s description of worlding highlights the interplay between constraints and possibilities.
		Through meaningful constraints comes infinite possibilities. Poets constrain their work using
		various structures or self-imposed logics, but also build upon and selectively break apart those
		structures by incorporating their own idiosyncratic use of language. Through offering both
		references to (perhaps multiple) systems of shared references and collective knowledge and one's
		own personal frameworks, poets create new worlds from this combination of different shared
		frameworks for interpreting reality and the poets own personal reality, worlds that the audience
		is able to semi-inhabit, and explore over time.
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={5}>

	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		This suggests a methodology that might be of use to graphic designers. Graphic designers can
		develop their own visual language in the same way that a poet might develop poetic frameworks
		through which to interpret reality, by fitting together multiple external and internal systems
		of meaning. Graphic designers are already adept at invoking widely shared, conventional systems
		of meaning in order to make our work function on the basis of clarity. But it is also possible
		for clarity to exist simultaneously with another, murkier kind of effect that comes from
		fortifying conventional logics of hierarchy, scale, and alignment with a graphic designer’s own
		internal logic and systems of meaning.
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={6}>The mythological chimera</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		I might call this methodology 'chimeric worlding', to emphasize the fact that these worlds,
		which graphic designers and their audience cohabitate through their work, are cobbled together
		from the DNA of various other worlds, and are richer because of this multiplicity. And I choose
		this word 'chimeric' not only for its meaning in the biological sense, i.e., 
	</Paragraph>
		<Blockquote>
			composed of material (such as DNA or polypeptide) from more than one organism,
		</Blockquote>
		<Paragraph>
			but also for its more
			metaphorical sense: 
		</Paragraph>
		
		<Blockquote>
			1) existing only as the product of unchecked imagination, fantastically
			visionary or improbable, 2) given to fantastic schemes. (Merriam-Webster)
		</Blockquote>
		
	<Paragraph>
		Under the methodology of 'chimeric worlding,' there is a call for epistemic disobedience, as the
		decolonial theorist Walter Mignolo calls it, for we all operate under symbolic systems of
		oppression. As graphic designers we have the ability to take those pervasive systems and strip
		them for parts, combining them with other, more marginalized knowledge. Something I’ve noticed
		about graphic designers (including myself) is that we are deeply invested in the vernacular. We
		love sifting through archives, not just libraries of objects and images of historical aesthetic
		traditions, but also the huge piles of pop culture, memes, forgotten digital artifacts, consumer
		products, etc, etc. We can take what has been deemed ‘low culture’ – perhaps given labels like
		‘esoterica’, ‘pop’, or ‘folk’, and give them equal importance with the more conventional
		historical design references. So much of what is considered ‘good’ or ‘correct’ or ‘legible’
		design comes from naturalized conventions of visual hierarchy and structure. Part of this
		methodology of 'chimeric worlding' involves the possibility of co-opting the aesthetics of
		structuralism, while recognizing it’s inherent arbitrariness. Common graphic design
		methodologies assert that every element needs to be there for a non-arbitrary reason, but what
		if the reason for a graphic design decision has less to do with legibility, and more to do with
		the greater worldbuilding that the graphic designer has already established? Arbitrariness is in
		fact emancipatory, and enables us to layer multiple logics and systems of knowledge.

	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		'Chimeric worlding' invites designers to create a cosmology for their work. There’s a
		relationship here to sacred geometry, to numerology, to mythos. Think of all the pre-modern
		frameworks that exist for graphically organizing the universe and all that it contains, and how
		it all functions. Think of the difference between the periodic table of elements and the
		classical elements of fire, earth, air, and water. Both worldviews imply their own associations,
		symbolic meanings, and spatial configurations, and conceptual relations. While only one of these
		systems remains canonical to modern scientific, both offer conceptual relations that might be
		useful to the designer-as-poet-as-worldbuilder. There’s an opportunity here to do comparative
		mythology, to mine the history and culture of various aesthetic frameworks as inspiration for
		organizing content, and for developing one’s own individualized visual language.

	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		Sci-fi and fantasy writers, have been doing this sort of thing for a while now, adapting various
		frameworks of knowledge to create new worlds. Another genre that employs worldbuilding, that the
		idea of 'chimeric worlding' also definitely owes a lot to, is magical realism. I’m especially
		thinking of the way that magical realism often operates through epistemic disobedience, by
		presenting to the reader a ‘realistic’ world that then gets disrupted.

	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		More literally, this relationship between fictional worlds and ‘the real world’ is evident in
		the fact that much of fictional worldbuilding heavily references various world mythologies,
		folktales and religions (everything from Thor in the <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i> to vampires and
		werewolves in the <i>Twilight</i> franchise), but in a way that flattens it and makes it more
		malleable. It’s like secularized mysticism, which might feel a tad blasphemous, but at the same
		time I don’t think there’s any stopping culture’s appetite for the recombination of meaning.
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={10}>
		Clow Cards from <i>Card Captor Sakura</i> based on tarot cards, and also just the idea of using archetypes to develop taxonomies. 
	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		Any existing taxonomy has the potential to be remixed and incorporated into worldbuilding. For example, elemental
		systems (like in <i>Pokemon</i>, or <i>Naruto</i>, or <i>Avatar: the Last Airbender</i>) originate from any number of
		different theories of the atomic makeup of matter (the four classical elements of fire, water,
		earth, air, the 5 elemental system in East Asia of fire, water, earth, metal, wood). The
		taxonomic system in <i>Digimon</i> comes from a more recent, technological framework of relationships
		between data, viruses, and vaccines. In <i>Full Metal Alchemist</i>, which establishes a magic system
		based on multiple historical-cultural definitions of alchemy, the antagonists are organized
		around the seven deadly sins from Christian philosophy. Other examples include references to
		tarot cards (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i>, <i>Persona 4</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i>), chakras (<i>Naruto</i>), different
		musical genres (<i>Trolls World Tour</i>), taxonomies of virtues, personality traits, or emotions
		(<i>Digimon</i> again, and even the Pixar movie Inside Out), divisions of labor in a dystopian
		imagining of society (<i>Hunger Games</i>, plus a slew of other YA dystopian series) or different
		theories of the relationship between mind, body, and soul (too many to count).
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		There are all of these ways that writers expand a world through its <Link href="https://otherinter.net/research/lore/">lore</Link>, and the great thing
		about lore is that it implies even more lore, that just hasn’t been made explicit to the
		audience yet, and is open to speculation. This is the kind of thing that fuels fandom. What if
		graphic designers could create work capable of garnering fan theories, multiple interpretations,
		and wild reimaginings? It would mean a depth of engagement with graphic design beyond the
		singular goal of clarity and communication.
	</Paragraph>
	<Subheader>Expanding the Limits of Graphic Design</Subheader>
	<Caption imgIndex={11}>
		Two extremes
	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		If Graphic Designers only rely on a set of conventions and references that are legible to the
		dominant culture, then they will inevitably just create things that are meant to be consumed as
		efficiently as possible, and nothing else. On the flipside, if designers only relied on a
		personal set of symbols and signifiers that are only meaningful to them, their work will be
		completely useless to others. The field of graphic design is oriented towards the public, and
		therein lies its strength. But it can be easy to forget that a public is made of individuals,
		and it can be hard to create things with entry points to open up individual interpretation by
		the audience. If the graphic designer develops a rich, hybridized, internal logic through which
		their body of work functions, even without explicitly explaining that logic, then the audience
		will be able to slowly piece that together, and to excavate the lore of the world that is
		created. Poetry and speculative fiction already do this. Graphic designers can, too.
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={12}>
		Finding a middle ground
	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		It bears clarifying that this methodology is not one that tells you to throw away all structure,
		to throw away all of your legacy Western European Graphic Design education and sensibilities.
		Instead, ‘chimeric worlding’ is a methodology that tells you to provincialize that education, to
		appropriate and reconfigure it as parts of new hybrids, and to consider it just one tool out of
		many possible tools, one structure out of many possible structures. This methodology is not one
		that is anti-structure. It is pro- multivarious and contradictory and ambiguous and poetic
		structures.
	</Paragraph>
	<Caption imgIndex={13}>
		composite materials as metaphor for cobbling together worlds
	</Caption>
	<Paragraph>
		As an analogy, I might say that this methodology is not one that says to make and then
		ultimately break the grid. Because the truth is, I, and most other graphic designers, like
		grids. So instead of breaking the grid, I want to make the grid my own, to claim its aesthetics
		for myself, and to imbue the grid itself with rich layers of connotative meaning and custom
		logic. The 'chimeric worlding’ version of a grid is both spatial and symbolic. It is a grid that
		binds itself to the texts and images that lay on top of it, wrapping around it and becoming the
		bones of a world. And the audience doesn’t necessarily have to understand it all. Is graphic
		design art? Is it a tool? Neither? Both and more? Within graphic design, the paradox need not be
		resolved. Clarity can co-exist with poetic ambiguity and the openness of interpretation.
		Legibility can co-exist with illegibility. Ambiguous structure (or perhaps structural
		ambiguity?) signals to the audience that there is a world here, and that it is worth engaging
		with. Even if they can only catch a glimpse at first, they know that there are surely hidden depths to
		discover.
